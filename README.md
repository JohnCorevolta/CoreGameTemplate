# CoreGameTemplate

A template repository for Core games.

## About this Template

This template provides you a quick way to get started with a Core game project on GitHub. It includes the following config files:

- `.luacheckrc` for linting and error checking your game scripts.
- `.gitignore` for preventing you from accidentally checking in unneeded files into the repository.
- `.editorconfig` for setting up a consistent code style across the project.

You are obviously free to change any of those, the default ones are just a baseline.

## Overview

XYZ is a GENRE kind of game on Core.
